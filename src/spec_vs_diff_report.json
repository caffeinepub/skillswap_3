Backend change to createLesson() size validation cannot be verified from the truncated backend diff, and it’s unclear whether *all* Upload Lesson helper/validation text mentions were updated due to truncation.",

      "reason": "The backend diff is truncated before showing createLesson() and any size-limit validation/error message logic, so there is no evidence that the 10MB limit and its error message were updated to 100MB.",
